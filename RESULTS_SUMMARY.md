# Medical Image Classification - Project Results

## Overview
Complete pneumonia detection system with actual dataset analysis and visualizations.

## Dataset (Downloaded & Analyzed)

### Statistics
- **Total Images**: 5,840
- **Total Size**: 2.29 GB
- **Source**: Kaggle - Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)

### Distribution

| Split | Class | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|-------|------------|
| Train | PNEUMONIA | 3,875 | 74.3% |
| Train | NORMAL | 1,341 | 25.7% |
| Test | PNEUMONIA | 390 | 62.5% |
| Test | NORMAL | 234 | 37.5% |

### Class Imbalance
- PNEUMONIA:NORMAL ratio = 2.89:1
- This imbalance is handled through:
  - Computed class weights during training
  - Data augmentation
  - Stratified validation split

## Generated Visualizations

All visualizations available in `results/` folder:

1. **class_distribution.png** - Bar charts showing class distribution in train/test sets
2. **sample_images_train.png** - Real chest X-ray samples from both classes
3. **image_properties.png** - Image dimension and aspect ratio distributions
4. **dataset_summary.csv** - Complete dataset statistics

## Model Performance (Expected)

Based on similar datasets and architectures:

| Model | Accuracy | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Simple CNN | 80-85% | Fast training, good baseline |
| Custom CNN (4-block) | 85-90% | Better feature extraction |
| VGG16 Transfer | 90-93% | Pre-trained on ImageNet |
| ResNet50 Transfer | 91-94% | Skip connections help |
| DenseNet121 Transfer | 92-95% | Best overall performance |
